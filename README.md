# IF YOU GET ERROR OR SOMETHING TO MY SCRIPT
- please check my script first before issues

P.S If you do nothing wrong my script will install termux useful packages and install kali-nethunter and update file for nethunter after you type nh -r
you will see nh_setup file or install nethunter packages (this script is slowest upgrade and install useful packages for nethunter (3000+ packages))
