# Termux-Nethunter
Complete setup termux and install nethunter

#How to use
After install termux type termux-setup-storage (should download my script with zip)

- cp $HOME/storage/downloads/<my script zip name> <new zip name>
- unzip <my script zip name> && chmod +x setup
- ./setup or bash setup
- Take a seat and drink some coffe or tea
  
#IF YOU GET ERROR OR SOMETHING TO MY SCRIPT
- please check my script first before issues

P.S If you do nothing wrong my script will install termux useful packages and install kali-nethunter and update file for nethunter after you type nh -r
you will see nh_setup file or install nethunter packages (this script is slowest upgrade and install useful packages for nethunter (3000+ packages))
  
  Sorry about my english skills
