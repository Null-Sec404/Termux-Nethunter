# Reuirements

After install termux type termux-setup-storage (should download zip and unzip in file explorer app) after unzip zip file

- cp $HOME/storage/downloads/setup <new file name>
- unzip <new file name> && chmod +x <new file name>
- ./<new file name> or bash <new file name>
- Take a seat and drink some coffe or tea and wait
- If you need to add extra keys type exit logout nethunter and chmod +x extra_keys && bash extra_keys 

# *AFTER INSTALLED NETHUNTER YOU WILL GET KALI LINUX TOOLS + NGROK NON TOKEN   
  
# IF YOU GET AN ERROR OR SOMETHING TO MY SCRIPT
- please check my script first before issues

P.S If you do nothing wrong my script will install termux useful packages and install kali-nethunter and update file for nethunter after you type nh -r
you will see nh_setup file or install nethunter packages (this script is slowest upgrade and install useful packages for nethunter (3000+ packages))
